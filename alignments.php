<div><p><em>Wheel alignment, sometimes referred to as breaking or tracking, 
is part of standard automobile maintenance that consists of adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they are set to the car maker's specification. 
The purpose of these adjustments is to reduce tire wear, and to ensure that vehicle travel is straight and true (without "pulling" to one side). 
Alignment angles can also be altered beyond the maker's specifications to obtain a specific handling characteristic. </em></p></div>

<p><em>Make sure your vehicle is in line with a wheel alignment from Puzzuoli's Mr. Muffler. 
If your vehicle feels unstable, an alignment service can improve driver safety, create a smoother ride and increase fuel efficiency.</em></p>
